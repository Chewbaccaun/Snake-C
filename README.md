# Snake-C
Yet another snake game (or just me trying to make one).
Snake Game is a popular game that can be played in any type of smartphone or computers. In this game, the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes the food. If the snake hits itself or the boundaries of the screen, the game ends.
